RHYTHMBOX FILEORGANIZER
=======================

-------------------------------------
WARNING, ONGOING DEVELOPMENT VERSION.
-------------------------------------

 * There are a lot of changes incoming as I haven't updated for a long time. (My last commit was Sep 16, 2013!)
 * Please be aware that for the moment this repo may have bugs that i haven't noticed in my testing.
 * I have tested all current features and they work as expected (But that isn't a promise it will be stable for you)

Welcome to version 3.1-dev-01

This is my first update in a major refactor and cleanup of the code.
My end goal is to make it easier for other people to read and understand how it works.
This was the plugin that really got me excited about python and hopefully someone else gets that same spark!

1.0 INSTALL

To install the plugin, simply double-click the INSTALL file.

To install from the terminal:
make install

If you want to install manually, extract to the following directory:
 * $HOME/.local/share/rhythmbox/plugins/fileorganizer/

Possible extra requirements are:
 * python-configparser (I have to confim this but i think it's a default module in python 3.2+)
 * gir1.2-notify-0.7 (Debian name, GObject notify library)

Please run python3 ./depends_test.py if you are having problems to check that all python libraries are present.

#######################

2.0 USAGE & MAIN FEATURES

This plugin is pretty simple but it has a few complicated features under the hood.

Once the plugin is installed, simply enable it in Rhythmbox. A restart of rhythmbox will be required to detect the plugin if it was open when you installed.

When the plugin is enabled, you will notice an option in the right-click menu of music items (like songs) that will read 'Organize selection'. Clicking this will organize the selected files following a defined structure (see 3. Configuration and customisation) for both folders and filenames. Thats all there is to it.


2.1 OTHER FEATURES

Intelligent duplicate backup:
 * When two songs have the same name, the plugin moves the file to a backup directory. 
 * If you lose a file, you'll probably in a folder named 'backup' in the root of your music library.

Move all non music files with your music:
 * When enabled, Fiileorganizer will move files like text files and pictures with that music file. 
 * This is great for keeping all files organised, not just music.

Import cover art into the Rhythmbox cache:
 * When enabled, the plugin will import cover art that it finds in the music folder. 
 * The default cache location is: $HOME/.cache/rhythmbox/covers/

Log file for all actions:
 * The log file is an invaluable tool to see what happens when running fileorganizer. 
 * By default this file is hidden in your home folder: $HOME/.fileorganizer.log

#######################

3.0 CONFIGURATION AND CUSTOMISATION

The output when running 'Organize Selection' is set from dconf-editor using default Rhythmbox settings:
 * org.gnome.rhythmbox.library/layout-filename (Is the filename for your output)
 * org.gnome.rhythmbox.library/layout-path (Is the folder path for your output)
 * org.gnome.rhythmbox.rhythmdb/locations (Is your library path)

Using these, your final output becomes:
 * library + layout-path + layout-filename

The Locations setting can actually be multiple locations, the first value is always taken by the plugin.

The Variables for layout_path and layout_filename follow the same values as rhythmbox:
 * %at -- album title
 * %aa -- album artist (Album artist will use track artist if it does not exist)
 * %aA -- album artist (lowercase)
 * %as -- album artist sortname
 * %aS -- album artist sortname (lowercase)
 * %ay -- album release year
 * %an -- album disc number
 * %aN -- album disc number, zero padded
 * %ag -- album genre
 * %aG -- album genre (lowercase)
 * %tn -- track number (i.e 8)
 * %tN -- track number, zero padded (i.e 08)
 * %tt -- track title
 * %ta -- track artist
 * %tA -- track artist (lowercase)

Variables not ported yet:
 * %ts -- track artist sortname
 * %tS -- track artist sortname (lowercase)


3.1 COMPILATION SUPPORT

Fileorganizer will use the album artist tag which is a part of rhythmbox and replace the artist field. For example:
 * Path: /music/$artist/$year $album/$disc-$track - $title
 * Input: /music/new/spawn soundtrack/01 - filter & the crystal method - trip like i do.mp3
 * Set Album Artist to 'Various' in Rhythmbox.
 * Output: /music/Various/1997 Spawn/1-01 - Can't You (Trip Like I Do).mp3


3.2 PLUGIN PREFERENCES WINDOW

The preferences window gives you the ability to switch features on or off. The 'Enabled' check boxes will obviously disable these features.

Log File:
 * Set the filename of the log file (stored in your home folder)

Import Cover Art
 * List of coverart filenames that if found are imported to the rhythmbox cover cache for that album

File/Folder Cleanup
 * If enabled, files within the same folder that aren't music files are moved as well

Remove Empty Folders
 * If the source folder is empty after moving, delete the folder
